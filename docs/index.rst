Plumbum: Shell Combinators
==========================

Ever wanted wrist-handiness of shell scripts, but in a modern, object-oriented language and 
a rich library? Say hello to *Plumbum Shell Combinators*. Plumbum (Latin for *lead*) is a small 
yet very functional library for writing programs a la shell scripts, but in python, of course. 
Plumbum treats programs as functions, which you can invoke to get run the program, and form
pipelines, just like you'd do in shells.
