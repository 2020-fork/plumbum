v 1.0
=====

* CLI:
    * finish tests
    * beautify code (_parse_args is a monster, less use of tuples)

* Core:
    * make local.cwd, local.env thread-safe? does it make sense to emulate a separate cwd/env
      each thread?
    * remote: handle ~ shortcuts in remote paths too?
    * remote: piping doesn't work as expected (it happens on the local host).
      need a way to convert ``foo | bar`` to ``rem[foo | bar]``

* Docs:
    * finish remote
